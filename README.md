##  How to install the project on the local machine

- You can click the _code_ drop-down menu as illustrated in the picture above and copy the link to clone the repo.
- Now go to your terminal and type: `git clone <the link here>` and then the repo will be cloned to your local machine.
- By now you have to open your IDE -I recommend VSCode- and open the project.
- Now you need to run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- After that you should setting up the database follow the steps :

    1.  Connect to postgres, by typing `psql` or `pgcli` in the terminal.
    2.  use these commands to create your database
        ```
        CREATE DATABASE db_name;
        CREATE USER user_name WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password';
        ALTER DATABASE db_name OWNER TO user_name;
        ```
    3.  Add a `.env` file and add the database's url in this format: `DB_URL = postgres://[username]:[password]@localhost:5432/[database]`.
    4. Copy build.sql path ```.../server/database/config/build.sql``` and run this command in terminal ```\i [build.sql path]```.
- to open a live page from your local machine project, you can run the `npm run dev` command which will open a live server to work with.
